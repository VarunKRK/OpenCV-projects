Green screens are widely used in Media domain, where we can create a new place from the place we are located, good example for this is Weather Forecasting.
The tool used in this scenario is **openCV**, so, here I'm going to apply openCV on a simple image where the green screen will be replaced with another background.

### ðŸ“¦ *Installation*

Install the required libraries into the the environment. Using the line below we can install the libraries.
You check the versions from the `requirements.txt`


```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### ðŸš€ *How to use*

Initially we to import the libraries
```python
import cv2 as cv
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```
### Notes

Next, have to load the image, here with `openCV` when we load the image it will load it as a `BGR` image so have to convert it into `RGB` image for further image processing, so we use a funtion called `cvtColor`. Here it goes..
```python
image = cv.imshow('image path in system')
# converting to RGB
image_rgb = cv.cvtColor(image, cv.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
```

For better colour seperation we use hsv gradient to sopt the green colour. Again the `image_rgb` has to be converted to `HSV` image.
```python
# converting to HSV
image_hsv = cv.cvtColor(image_rgb, cv.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
```
